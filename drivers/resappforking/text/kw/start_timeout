Wait for `<duration>` before declaring the app launcher start action a failure.

Takes precedence over `timeout`.

If neither `timeout` nor `start_timeout` is set, the agent waits indefinitely
for the app launcher to return.

A timeout can be coupled with `optional=true` to not abort a service instance
`start` when an app launcher did not return.
