If the route is not a redirect (`host_redirect` and/or `path_redirect` are
not specified), one of `cluster`, `cluster_header`, or `weighted_clusters`
must be specified.

When `cluster_header` is specified, Envoy will determine the cluster to
route to by reading the value of the HTTP header named by `cluster_header`
from the request headers.

If the header is not found or the referenced cluster does not exist, Envoy
will return a 404 response.
