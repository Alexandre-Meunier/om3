Wait for `<duration>` before declaring the app launcher action a failure.

Can be overridden by `<action>_timeout`.

If no timeout is set, the agent waits indefinitely for the app launcher to
return.

A timeout can be coupled with `optional=true` to not abort a service instance
action when an app launcher did not return.
