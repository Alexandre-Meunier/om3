The daemon will try to restart a resource if:

* The resource is `down`, `stdby down` or `warn`.

* The instance has `local_expect=started` in its daemon monitor data, which
  means the daemon considers this instance is and should remain started.

* The node is not frozen

* The instance is not frozen

In this case, the daemon try `restart=<n>` times before falling back to the
monitor action.

The `restart_delay` keyword sets the interval after a failed restart before
the next tentative.

Resources with `standby=true` have `restart` forced to a minimum of 2, to
increase chances of a restart success.
