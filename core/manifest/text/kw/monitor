A resource with `monitor=true` will trigger the `monitor_action`
(crash or reboot the node, freezestop or switch the service) if:

* The resource is `down`.

* The instance has `local_expect=started` in its daemon monitor data, which
  means the daemon considers this instance is and should remain started.

* All restart tentatives failed.
