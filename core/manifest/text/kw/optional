Action errors on optional resources are logged but do not stop the action
sequence.

The optional resources status is not aggregated in the instance availability
status, but aggregated in the overall status.

Resource tagged `noaction` and sync resources are considered optional by
default.

Dump filesystems are a typical use-case for `optional=true`.
