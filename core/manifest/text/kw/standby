If `true`, always start the resource, even on non-started instances.

The daemon is responsible for starting standby resources.

A resource can be set standby on a subset of nodes using keyword scoping.

A typical use-case is a synchronized filesystem on non-shared disks. The
remote filesystem must be mounted to not overflow the underlying filesystem.

> **Warning**: In most situation, don't set shared resources standby, a
  non-clustered fs on shared disks for example.
