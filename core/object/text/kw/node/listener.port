The port the daemon raw listener must listen on.

In pull action mode, the collector sends a tcp packet to the server to notify
there are actions to unqueue. The opensvc daemon executes the
`dequeue actions` node action upon receive.

The `listener.port` value is sent to the collector on `pushasset`.
