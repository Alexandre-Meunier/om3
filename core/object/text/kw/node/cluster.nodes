This list of node names contains only the local node name on install.

When the node joins a cluster, the joined node provides the new list,
with the new node added. The joiner then replace its nodes list with
the one received.

When a node receives a join request, it adds the new node to its
cluster nodes list, then provide the new list to the joiner.
