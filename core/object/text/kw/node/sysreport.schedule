Schedule parameter for the `sysreport` node action, which collects into an
archive all files and command outputs defined in /etc/opensvc/sysreport and
sends that archive to the collector.

The collector stores the unpacked files in a per-node git repository.

See `usr/share/doc/schedule` for the schedule syntax.
