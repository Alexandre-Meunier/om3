When the daemon has so many actions to submit in parallel that the
`node.max_parallel` limit is reached, this `priority` is used to determine
which service are served first.

The `priority` is an just an number used as a sort key. The smaller the
number, the higher the priority.

The priority setting is dropped from a service configuration injected via the
api by a user not having the prioritizer grant.
