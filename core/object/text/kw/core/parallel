If set to `true`, actions are executed in parallel on the resource of this subset.

For example, a service with:

```
[app#1]
start = /bin/true

[app#2]
start = /bin/true

[app#3]
start = /bin/true
subset = workers

[app#4]
start = /bin/true
subset = workers

[subset#app:workers]
parallel = true
```

Would have a start sequence like:

```
app#1 ---> app#2 -+-> app#3
                  `-> app#4
```
