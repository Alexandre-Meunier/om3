A node selector expression specifying the list of cluster nodes hosting
object encapsulated instances.

An object with container resources can have resources managed by OpensSVC
agents deployed in these containers.
These encapsulated agents form an encapsulated cluster, usually a single
node cluster for a failover service.

For example a `test/svc/s1` failover service, with a `container#0` resource
managing a `e1` lxc host, can define `encapnodes = e1`.
A `app#1` resource with `encap = true` is then managed by the OpenSVC
agent in `e1`.
