A node selector expression specifying the list of cluster nodes hosting
object instances.

If not specified or left empty, the node evaluating the keyword is
assumed to be the only instance hosting node.

Labels can be used to define a list of nodes by an arbitrary property.
For example `cn=fr cn=kr` would be evaluated as `n1 n2 n3` if `n1` and
`n2` have the `cn=fr` label and `n3` has the `cn=kr` label.

The glob syntax can be used in the node selector expression. For
example `n1 n[23] n4*` would be expanded to `n1 n2 n3 n4` in a
`n1 n2 n3 n4 n5` cluster.
