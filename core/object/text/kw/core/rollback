If set to `false`, the default *rollback on start action error* behaviour is
disabled, leaving the instance in its half-started state (avail `warn`).

The daemon then refuses to failover a service if any instance is in `warn`
availabity state. It is highly recommended to not use `rollback=false` if
`orchestrate=ha`.
