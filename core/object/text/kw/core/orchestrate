Orchestrate defines how the daemon will manage the service.

* `no`
  The daemon does not try to keep the service `up`.
  On boot, the service won't be started.

  The daemon does not try to reach the `flex_target` number of `up` instances
  for flex services.

* `start`
  Services with `topology=failover` won't failover automatically only if the
  target instance is the natural placement leader. Which means the service is
  started when its primary node reboots, if it does not run elsewhere already.

  The daemon does not try to reach the `flex_target` number of `up` instances
  for flex services.

* `ha`
  Services with `topology=failover` failover automatically.

  The daemon tries to reach the `flex_target` number of `up` instances for
  flex services.

The resource restart policy is not affected by the `orchestrate` value.
